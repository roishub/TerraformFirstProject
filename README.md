# TerraformFirstProject
My First Terraform Project

For this project, I set up a special virtual network called a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). It's like creating your own private space on the internet. Within this VPC, I made two separate areas, sort of like different rooms, called subnets. These subnets help keep things organized and secure.

To make sure our applications can be accessed from the Internet, I set up something called an Internet gateway. It's like a door that allows data to flow in and out securely.

To help the data travel smoothly, I created a route table. It directs network traffic to the appropriate destination, ensuring efficient communication between different parts of the VPC and the internet.

I also set up security groups. They make sure only the right kind of traffic gets in and the bad stuff stays out. It's an important part of keeping our system safe.

We needed some storage space for our data, so I created what's called an S3 bucket. You can think of it like a big online storage box where we can put all our stuff.

To make sure everything runs smoothly, I made two special computers in the cloud, called EC2 instances. I associated them with the security group so they play by the rules and stay safe.

Because we want our system to handle a lot of visitors without crashing, I set up a load balancer. It's like having a traffic manager that makes sure each of our computers doesn't get too overwhelmed. I connected it with the security group and the subnets to keep everything secure and in the right place.

And guess what? I did all of this using a tool called Terraform. It's like a special set of instructions that helps to build and manage all these different parts without too much hassle. It's pretty neat, right?
